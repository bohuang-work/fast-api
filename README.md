# fast-api

    FastAPI is a very fast (high-performance) web framework.
    * It has "Starlette" work as Asynchronous serive framework work under the hood. "Starlette" not only allows multiple incoming events and outgoing events for each application, but also allows for a background coroutine so the application can do other things
    * It use "Pydantic", which enforces type of the input/output of your endpoints, and provide friendly error when data is invalid.
    * fully compatible with the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
